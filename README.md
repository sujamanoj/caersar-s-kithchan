# Caesar's-Kitchen

## Purpose

Ceasars Kitchen is a family-owned business. They offer a variety of Food products (Buffalo Style Chicken Mac & Cheese, Cheese Lasagna Roulette, Difference Authentic Versions of Cauliflower Rice, ect.) to deliver directly to the customers.

## Objective

We are recreating Caesar’s Kitchen website. We are looking to boost the existing website and add an E-commerce SPA with Stripe for payment processing so customers are able to order and pay online through Caesar’s Kitchen website.

## Goals
Our intention is to create an easy-to-use storefront in which users would be able to browse and shop for food entrees made by Caesar’s Kitchen. Our plan is to add a page to the existing website and make the products easily available for the customers. Having said that, we would like to recreate their back-end database with growth in mind.

## Solution
We will make an easy-to-use front end for users to shop on while providing an automatic back-end. We will create an E-commerce for Caesar’s Kitchen which they don’t have.
